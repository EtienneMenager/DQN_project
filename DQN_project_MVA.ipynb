    "The function act allows the agent to choose an action in a given state, both during the training period and the test period. During the learning period, the agent have to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemna (trade-off between obtaining new knowledge and using the current knowledge). In fact, the agent have to answer the following question: when he has tried an action that leads to good results, should he continue to choose it or try something else that may lead to better performance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, during the training, we want our agent to use the learned policy to test its results and to try other actions to find better behaviour in order to improve the policy (if it exists). To do this, we implement the epsilon-greedy exploration: the agent chooses the action given by the policy with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ (exploitation) and try a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ (exploration). This allows the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. \n",

    "We can see on the function  $\\textit{act}$ and $\\textit{reset}$ the role of the arrays $\\textit{position}$  and $\\textit{board}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we can see that the array $\\textit{board}$ allows to define where the cheese and poisonous are on the island. So $\\textit{board}$ defines the reward we have in the different cells. In fact, $\\textit{board}$  represents the environment as a grid where there is $0.5$ for cheese, $0$ for a neutral cell and $-1$ for a poisonous cell. To get the current reward, we just query this array with the command $\\textit{board}[x, y]$ where $[x,y]$ is the current position of the agent. Note that, if the rat is on a cell where something is, it eats it and the current cell  $\\textit{board}[x, y]$ becomes a neutral cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can see that the array $\\textit{position}$ is related to the position of the agent on the grid and the bounds of the grid: we put 1 where the agent is and -1 where the grid boundaries are. We define a boundary around the environment because we consider that a $10 \\times 10$ grid is contained in a $14 \\times14$ grid to take into account the fact that the rat sees $5\\times 5$ cells around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : i find an error in the code of self.position. There's twice the line $self.position[-2:, :] = -1$ and no occurence of $self.position[:, -2:] = -1$."
